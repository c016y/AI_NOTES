Reader,

I'd like to reflect on an answer I gave in response to being asked the following:

"What suggestions, ideas, or concerns do you have for yourself or the department?"

-

For privacy reasons, here was my redacted 3AM response at the end of another 70+ hour work week:

"Address the skilled labor shortage by open sourcing our industry. [COMPANY] should be the best and most reputable online public access resource for [INDUSTRY RELATED TASKS] readiness program with the purpose of preparing new candidates for the field. 

There's a gap in the social-sphere. People watch hours of videos like carpenters building cabinets, 3D-printing toys, pottery, etc. People would also watch hours of people [EXAMPLES OF INDUSTRY RELATED TASKS]".

I point out the details of the origin of this response because there are so many ways to improve, it drives me crazy the inaction of those with real leverage. 

My current professional goal is to improve things... but it always comes at a cost. This idea/dynamic is what puts food on my table and allows my wife and children to stay warm this time of year.

I'm positive there are good motives and well-prepared reasons that certain choices are made within an organization, and I have no personal vendetta against anyone person or thing. However, I'd like this text to be the starting point to greater and more powerful outcomes.

Though I agree the above could be or sound prideful or arrogant (who am I, even?), I think there are so many variables to the problems I face on a day-to-day that the only way forward is open and honest communication at all levels and outlets.

I'll cut to the chase.

I work in an industry influenced by technology. I'm talking about companies that move the digital landscape. People invested in the research, development, and practical application of the limits of optical and electrical engineering. Their goal is to capture and move data, and the decisions they make have the power to change markets and alter human behavior.

I (and my team) are stuck with the grunt work, building things for people at this scale to operate. The demand is high, and the output is highly variable.

There is a stark difference in how my customers operate as compared to the subcontractors they hire. The field of information technology is so open to opportunity that the global market value for the software industry alone could double or even triple in size within the next 10 years. Their roles are so sought after that people apply from around the world. Their marketing is integrated with their social presence and their product is well known. The entire knowledge base of their industry is open-source, and gathering skills can be performed through a laptop, as there is endless content online of how their work is performed.

Working for these customers is difficult as they are highly specialized people. Many are rigid rule followers, others just care that things work (or work out, rather). They all agree on one thing, however, as most humans do: I will reward you if you do me good, and I will ignore you (or worse) when I am wronged.

Spare malicious actors, the obvious solution to always being rewarded is to always do good. This becomes tricky in my industry, especially with my customers. First of all, who is deciding what's good, and by what metrics are we calling it good? How do you accurately capture and measure good? Can you ensure it is captured and measured on a regular enough cadence? What is the optimum cadence of capture and measurement that maximizes risk-reduction but minimizes cost? Who is analyzing the captured measurements and what decisions can be made using it? What if the things needed for it to be good haven't arrived? What if those things aren't sold anymore? What if there's weather that prevents us from making it good? What if I can't hire enough good people to make it good? Can I make it good with the people I have?

There are so many variables that I believe no human or group of humans could ever process it manually. It requires data from so many facets of so many business sectors from project management, asset management, manufacturing, field engineering, logistics, IT, HR, safety/OSHA, recruiters, instructors, laborers, and those who recruit them to name a few.

It seems like an impossible task, even with the modern tools at our employees disposal. However, the entire landscape of software is evolving, driven by the very thing we strive to improve. This has spurred an entire generational shift in how we interact with each other, how we perform our work, how we learn, and what we spend our time doing.

Gone are the days of being lost on the road. Soon, you won't even need to drive your car, it will drive you. Why analyze data when you can ask a robot to analyze and format it for you? Why would a marketing firm ever spend another dime on a copywriter when a robot can do it better and faster? Why go meet people in person when you can just video call them? Why go to a class when you learn the same thing online?

Unlike software, these changes haven't been so nice to me and my team.

88%-94% of firms in my industry report difficulty finding skilled workers. This is at the cusp of what many consider a Gold Rush equivalent event; Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Market growth from this one innovation is akin to the cotton-gin, the Model-T, the telephone, the semi-conductor, and the internet. Never before have we (I?) ever needed skilled employees that can implement the structure to support something as complicated as this.

So how do we address the generational gap? How can we reach those who may find our industry fascinating and take interest in our goals?

For starters, hardly anyone knows we exist. Everyone does in principle, but not in practice. I certainly didn't understand what I was getting myself into at the ripe age of 20. I remember being told early in my career to keep this industry a secret. It had become a hidden gem to many for decades, an era that I think is coming to an end.

The new generation does not seek employment, employment seeks them. If their parents do not instill some sort of hobby or habit, you can bet their phone will. This is the heart of the first part of my response: "Address the skilled labor shortage by open sourcing our industry...".

Companies have to fight for the best of the bunch, a battle that is won with math and strategy. Companies that have a public presence will get more applications, have more outreach, and can more easily drive public opinion. They become pillars in communities that drive education and innovation. If not for publicity alone, the marketing generated, ad-revenue, and user data ("The Algorithm") should entice even the most skeptical of fund managers. This is without mention of "Creative "Destruction" caused by shifts in trends and inability to adapt.

What I am pitching is two concepts. One, train and educate the public. The other is more abstract.

Working for companies at the scale we do generates a ton of data. How that data is captured, when it's captured, and what you do with the data after it's captured is a tall task. We've already covered human limitation for data processing, but that is no longer a barrier for the exact reasons we've been talking about.

Honing in on how we capture data, being diligent about what data we capture, building and integrating tools that make (more) accurate data capture possible, and developing modern methods for data analyzation and reporting are becoming more essential. We've already seen an increase in expected reporting metrics from our customers for anything from manpower to time-studies. They want the information live, as it happens, in order to drive decisions they should have made yesterday. To make the stakes higher, the information we feed them generates changes, things that cause on-the-fly pivots that could effect hundreds of peoples paychecks down the line if not communicated properly.

My vision is a unified platform. Autodesk is already making attempts at this, and is already used by many of our customers. Tools such as these provide a more centralized data-structure that can be fed into machine-learning models. These modern tools allow for customized output and make data connections not previously imagined. As a working example, an online enthusiast has taken the entirety of Wikipedia as a data set and made observations that no human could make in their lifetime. He also created his own metric gathering model to train a Wii-Sports Baseball bot that won against the in-game AI 15 times in a row, and a completely autonomous YouTube channel that has reached monetized status (can generate money through ad-revenue). 

Big players in specific blue-collar industries need to pay attention. Build as advanced training facility as money can buy and use it as a recording studio. Fit it out with talented instructors who know how to be on camera and a good content-production team that know how to research/write/publish. While your at it, give/get yourself some rack space to play with AI/ML like those who dictate our future are doing.

I understand money doesn't grow on trees, but I can see writing on the wall and I'm sure everyone around me see's it too. Covid-19 cemented technology into our lives and AI/ML is built to ensure it stays. Compute power is estimated to use anywhere from 8% to 11.7% of US power demand by 2030, a 2- or 3- fold increase from todays metrics.

Being a public face will generate engagement. People who are interested will come to you if they see who you are and what you do. If you happen to solicit your company through free educational content then you end up with people that so happen to be trained on day one. Concepts can be packaged smaller to target younger audiences, with content being part of extra-curricular classes in high-schools, Jr. Colleges and Tech-Schools.

All of this generates user data, on-top of all of the data normal business generates. Companies now more than ever have the ability to web this data together and make data driven decisions about how to move forward, how to better engage with a client, automatically report information to the client, and more.

Now to address this novel. 

I am not a Software/AI/ML Engineer/Developer and I am not a Professional Video Producer. I want to take solutions that already work in so many aspects of our lives and implement them into any of the obvious inefficiencies of business operations.

Reader, thank you if you've made it this far. Please help me in poking holes in this text, as this is not an endeavor that I can do alone. I am aware that this is a bias ladened body of writing, but I hope it brings insight, and if I'm lucky, someone who's willing to help me get better understand the world.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, disagreements, or general feedback/inquiry, please do not hesitate to call me.

Thank you,

Colby Pierce
