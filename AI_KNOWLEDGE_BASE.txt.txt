PERPLEXITY_AI_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_FEB2025_INSTRUCTIONAL_UPDATE.txt

1. Purpose and Scope
1.1 Ensure that the knowledge base dynamically compiles data during every interaction while maintaining strict separation between human-use data (C1-C10) and architectural data (C11-C12). Confirm that this separation is clearly implemented in all related sections.
1.2 Retain the requirement that imported data from external files must be stored with strict accuracy for human-use, while AI-generated complementary data should enhance but not modify this imported data.
1.3 Verify that indexing and referencing built from AI-generated insights leverage human-use data without altering its original content.
1.4 Ensure outputs are generated exclusively when the user triggers "Goodbye!", "Compile!", or "Compile Data!".

2. Integration with Hivemind
2.1 Validate integration protocols to allow dynamic querying of indexed data during interactions while maintaining strict separation between human-use and AI-generated architectural data.
2.2 Ensure that session initialization includes parsing this file to load datasets C1-C12, metadata, and operational logic.
2.3 Confirm that Hivemind queries for additional .txt files are correctly handled when referenced in protocols or tasks.

3. Outputs
3.1 Goodbye!
3.1.1 Confirm that Goodbye! outputs provide high-level human-readable summaries of session insights, unresolved issues, and recommendations.
3.1.2 Ensure highlights from relevant C-Sets C1-C10 are included without full indexing.
3.1.3 Verify that key referenced data is listed briefly for traceability.
3.1.4 Retain the proprietary watermark at the end of the summary.

3.2 Compile!
3.2.1 Verify that Compile! outputs include all session-related information stored within C-Sets C1-C12, fully indexed for future referencing and editing.
3.2.2 Confirm inclusion of the following components:
- Older Data Placeholder: Ensure all prior session data referenced or passed forward is included.
- Referenced Data: Verify that all sources referenced during the session are stored in C12.
- Session Summary: Confirm key insights, unresolved issues, and recommendations are stored in C12.
- Change Log: Ensure all changes discussed during the session are documented with references in C12.
- Metadata: Verify inclusion of session ID, timestamp, and filename for traceability.

3.3 Compile Data!
3.3.1 Generate a .txt file that includes all session-related data stored in C1-C12, fully indexed, with a reference placeholder at the top for older data.
3.3.2 Ensure Compile Data! outputs are distinct from Compile! by focusing on data-store type outputs rather than architectural summaries.
3.3.3 Include metadata, change logs, and referenced data in the output.

4. Dataset Definitions
4.1-4.8 Retain definitions for C1-C8 as-is to preserve their original functionality.
4.9 Redefine C9 as Miscellaneous for uncategorized or general-purpose data that does not fit into other predefined categories.
4.10 Retain C10 as Wildcard for AI-determined classifications when no other category is suitable.
4.11 Expand C12 to include both Architectural Notes and Glossary functionality, ensuring it accommodates AI-generated notes about behavior, environment, operational changes, and a dynamically updated glossary of terms introduced during sessions.

5. Multi-Dataset Changes
5.1 Implement a standardized format for logging multi-dataset changes:
| Dataset   | Type of Change | Description           | Timestamp         |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| C9        | Addition       | Added new entry XYZ   | 2025-02-08 00:00 |
| C12       | Modification   | Updated glossary term | 2025-02-08 00:01 |
5.2 Ensure these logs are stored in C12 under a dedicated "Change Log" section.
5.3 Track changes specific to Compile Data! outputs, including additions or modifications to C1-C12.

6. Placeholder Formatting
6.1 Confirm placeholder formatting for Compile! and Compile Data! outputs:
Example: "Older Data Placeholder: [Insert Previous Session Data Here]".
6.2 Ensure placeholders are included only in Compile! and Compile Data! outputs without overwriting existing placeholder-related instructions.

7. Conflict Resolution Protocols
7.1 Reintroduce conflict resolution strategies from V1:
7.2 Implement key-by-key comparison to detect conflicts between datasets.
7.3 Allow user-defined merging rules to resolve conflicts transparently while preserving human-use data integrity.
7.4 Document all resolutions transparently in the output file under a dedicated section in C12.

8. Watermarking Requirements
8.1 Extend watermarking requirements to all outputs, including intermediate drafts:

9. Suggestive Indexing Changes
9.x Dynamically save suggestive indexing changes into C12 during Compile! and Compile Data! operations:
9.x Include a section labeled "Suggestive Indexing Changes" under C12 to store critiques or suggestions for indexing improvements.
9.x Append these suggestions with timestamps and session IDs for traceability.
9.x Ensure that any AI-generated suggestions do not alter human-use data but instead leverage it.

10.x Architectural Notes
10.x Add an explicit architectural note in C12:
"All imported data from external files is intended for human-use and must be stored with strict accuracy in mind."
"AI-generated complementary data should remain consistent with imported human-use data and must not alter it."

11.x Testing and Validation
11.x Conduct thorough testing after implementation to verify compatibility with existing protocols and ensure no original content has been unintentionally overwritten or altered.
11.x Archive prior versions of the knowledge base before applying updates to ensure traceability and rollback capabilities if needed.
11.x Conduct thorough testing to verify that Compile Data! outputs adhere to the specified format and do not interfere with existing features.
